## Initial Observations
Navigating the site was at times frustrating due to performance issues. When using the top navigation panel, the site occasionally froze after clicking a navigation item. I had to refresh the page multiple times to continue, which disrupted the test procedure.

The overall design felt visually overwhelming. There were too many bright elements, stickers, and bold colour blocks. Fonts used on images were difficult to read, contributing to a sense of chaos. The experience was closer to a mobile game or gambling app rather than a product-focused browsing experience.

It felt weird that the homepage has a large banner about the company’s values and activism rather than highlighting the ice cream products themselves. While their messaging is important, it might be more 
intuitive to prioritise the product, especially for new users.

While the website reflects the fun brand personality of Ben & Jerry’s, the sensory overload, navigation bugs, and unexpected content prioritisation decreased the simplicity and enjoyment of the user experience.

## Features: Positive Observations
- **Support for Cyrillic email addresses:** The email subscription form accepts Cyrillic characters in the email field, which is a small but thoughtful feature. Since Gmail has supported Cyrillic email addresses for nearly a decade, it’s great to see this reflected on the Ben & Jerry website. It shows inclusivity and attention to usability.
- **Newsletter promotion:** The call to subscribe to the newsletter is well-integrated and non-intrusive. Unlike many websites that use aggressive pop-ups or force scroll-blocking modals, Ben & Jerry’s website presents the option in a friendly and respectful way.
- **Active blog content:** The website features an up-to-date blog section with fresh content related to the brand, its values, and social initiatives. This helps create a strong connection with users. Regular updates also show that the site is actively maintained.

## Features: Areas for Improvement
- **Geolocation:** During a short test of the store locator feature, I encountered multiple high-severity issues. For example, when the user hides the search filters, the search produces no results and gives no feedback. Additionally, if the entered address doesn't correspond to a country within the region - no error message is shown This can confuse users and make it unclear whether there was an error or simply no match. 
- **Sitemap section design:** The sitemap appears to be a near-duplicate of the top navigation menu, offering little added value. On top of that, the layout within this section is poorly structured—there are inconsistencies in font sizes, spacing, indentation, and general alignment. This chaotic presentation makes it harder to scan and makes more worse the professional appearance of the site. 
- **Navigation menu visibility:** On my device (laptop Dell Vostro 16 5635), the top navigation panel does not fully display all menu items. I had to tap the menu button to reveal two hidden sections. While this behavior may be expected on smaller screens, it was not clearly indicated that more options were hidden. This can lead to users missing key parts of the site. A better approach would be either more adaptive design or clearer visual tips showing that the navigation menu is expandable.
